            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And though we be a ſinful nation, a nation laden with iniquity, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt children, and the ſeed of evill doers, yet do not thou caſt us off from being thine inheritance; Let not thy wrath burn like fire, and let not thine anger continue from Generation to Generation, but be thou pleaſed and reconciled with us in the death &amp; paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and for his ſake be thou merciful unto us, and forgive us all our ſins, and give us thy grace, that ever hereafter we may ſerve thee in holineſſe and righteouſeſſe all the dayes of our life; make us more and more thankful unto thee for all thoſe favours and mercies, and loving kindneſſes, that thou haſt continually ſo graciouſly, and ſo mercifully beſtowed upon us; increaſe our faith more and more, ſtirre up our hope, and kindle our charity both towards thee and our neighbours for thy ſake; give us true repentance for our former
<pb facs="tcp:41849:3"/>ſins, and a conſtant reſolution ever hereafter to lead a holy and an upright life. Grant us that meanes and maintenance whereby we may be inabled to ſerve thee; not too much, leſt we be too proud, and ſo forget thee, nor too little, leſt we ſhould want, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of thy mercy: but of thy goodneſſe grant us that competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and ſufficiencie, whereby we may be inabled to ſerve thee, and not be chargeable, but rather helpfull unto others. Bleſſe O Lord my family, my wife and children, and all that belong unto me; Bleſſe the two Univerſities, of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford:</hi> And bleſſe likewiſe the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that do continually wait at thine Altar, and eſpecially thoſe reverend Biſhops, that are yet alive in theſe dominions: and thou that art the Judge of all the world, be a juſt and a righteous Judge, betwixt us and them, that have taken away the reward of our labours, and have hindred us to diſcharge our duties, and cauſed us, that have ſate in ſcarlet, to imbrace dunghils; we do acknowledge and confeſſe, that we have moſt worthily deſerved all the miſeries that are come upon us, and much more, if thou ſhouldeſt deal with us according to our deſerts, and puniſh us according to the multitude of our ſinnes. But we know, Lord, that thou deſireſt not the death of a ſinner, thou takeſt no pleaſure in the deſtruction of the living, but rather that they ſhould turn from their wicked ways and live; and if thou, Lord, ſhouldſt be extream to mark what is done amiſſe, O Lord who may abide it? when as the beſt of us all is not able to anſwer Thee one of a thouſand; and therefore we do moſt humbly and moſt earneſtly beſeech thee, not to deal with us according to our deſerts, nor to puniſh us according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of our ſins; but according to the multitude of thy mercies, to do away our offences, and to give us thy grace, that ever hereafter we may ſerve thee in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of our life. Make an end of this waſting diviſion that is amongſt us, free us from theſe dangers, and deliver us from theſe troubles; O let not our enemies ſtill prevail to triumph over us, and to trample us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet, as mire and clay in the ſtreets, but let the light of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſhine on us, let thine ears hear our prayers, let our cry come unto thee, and let thine eyes behold our miſeries, and our troubles, which we ſuffer at the hands of them that hate us: And as thou didſt deliver the Iſraelites thy people from the oppreſſions of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; ſo deliver us, O Lord our God, out of all our troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and let not our ſins hinder thy mercics towards us, but be thou gracious and merciful unto us, to pardon and to forgive all our ſins, and to make ſpeed to ſave us, to make haſte to help us; becauſe we have none in heaven nor in earth, to make our complaint unto, but only unto thee, O God; and therefore we do moſt humbly, and moſt earneſtly beſeech thee to be our good God, gracious and mercifull unto us; to pardon, and to forgive us all our ſins, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us out of all our troubles, and to reſtore every man to his full and perfect right again. So ſhall we praiſe and glorify thee, O Lord; we ſhall honour and magnify thee in the great congregation,
<pb facs="tcp:41849:4"/>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: to whom with thee O Father, and thee O bleſſed Spirit, three perſons and one immortal, inviſible, indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and onely one wiſe God, be given and aſcribed from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our hearts, as is moſt due unto thee, all poſſible thanks, praiſe, power, might, majeſty, dominion, and glory, both now and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, world without end. Amen.</p>
            <p>O eternall God, Son of God, Lamb of God, that takeſt away the ſins of the world, I pray thee take away my ſins, and call them not to remembrance to lay the puniſhment thereof either upon me, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other for my ſake; but be thou gracious and merciful unto me, to pardon and forgive me all my ſins, and to give me thy grace, that I may lead all my life according to thy moſt holy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will. And now Lord, I do moſt humbly and earneſtly beſeech thee to accept this morning ſacrifice of praiſe and thanksgiving, which I offer unto thy divine majeſty, from the bottom of my heart, for all thoſe mercies, favours, and loving kindneſſe, both ſpiritual and temporal, which thou haſt ſhewed unto me from the hour of my birth to this very day; and aſpecially for theſe favours, that thou haſt delivered me from all dangers, both by Sea and Land, and haſt brought me hither ſafe, to give thanks and praiſe unto thy holy name: thou haſt alſo freed me from the fiery purgatory, from the Laborinth of Law-ſuits, and thou haſt finiſhed my buſineſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my deſire, and far better then I could expect; thou haſt helped and aſſiſted me to preach thy word, unto thy people, and haſt granted me their love and favour for the ſame.</p>
            <p>O Lord my God, I do thank thee with all my heart, and praiſe thee with all my ſoule, for theſe, as for all other thy mercies that thou haſt ſhewed unto me; and if it be thy bleſſed will, to grant me that favour, which I deſire of thee, that I may not offend thee; I ſhall thank thee while I live, and praiſe thee while I breath; but let thy will be done, and not mine; for mine is fraile, and thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt what is beſt, which I do not; and therefore I humbly beſeech tee to give me thy grace, that whatſoever thou doeſt, I may wholly ſubmit my ſelf to thy bleſſed will, and praiſe thee for the ſame while I live: And for mine endeavours to explain thoſe myſteries, which thou haſt revealed unto thy ſervant <hi>John,</hi> I do moſt humbly, and moſt earneſtly entreat thee, to inſpire me with thy bleſſed Spirit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten me with thy grace, that I may truly underſtand them, &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explain them unto thy people; and if thou ſeeſt it for thy glory, and the benefit of thy Church, I pray thee help and aſſiſt me, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and enable me to finiſh the ſame, and to publiſh them unto the world; or, if thou ſeeſt it not for thy glory and the benefit of thy Church; I beſeech thee, let them be like the unntmely fruit of a woman, that periſheth before it ſeeth the Sun; becauſe I deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hereby, neither praiſe nor profit, but onely to diſcharge my duty to the uttermoſt of mine ability, for the ſetting forth of thy praiſe and glory, and the benefit of thy Church and people, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thoſe that are in errour unto the true faith, and the right ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of thee, O God, and confirming thoſe that are in the right;
<pb facs="tcp:41849:4"/>to continue conſtant therein unto the end. And to this end, I beſeech thee to reſtore our King and Governour, and all the exiled perſons that are with him, unto their places and dignities again; that they may be the inſtruments whereby thy ſervice may be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, thy people truly inſtructed, and thy name religiouſly glorified; by the acknowledgement of thy juſtice, in our puniſhment for our transgreſſions, thy great mercy and goodneſſe in relieving and helping us in our neceſſities, and thine infinite power, wiſdome, and goodneſſe in ſuppreſſing our enemies, and delivering us out of their hands, that we might ſerve thee without fear in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of our life. Hear us O Lord our God, and grant theſe our requeſts unto us, and whatſoever elſe thou knoweſt to be requiſite and neceſſary for us for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake, and diſpoſe of me to do all things according to thy moſt holy and bleſſed will; ſo ſhall I praiſe and glorifie thee for ever and ever.

            </p>
            <p>But you may obſerve this difference betwixt <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that <hi>David</hi> had many wives and concubines, which we do not read that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had; and <hi>David</hi> committed more perſonal and particular ſins, as his adultry, and the murdering of <hi>Urias,</hi> and the numbring of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his raſh judgement againſt honeſt <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> then we find in all the <hi>22.</hi> years reign of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet <hi>David</hi> hath this Elogie and commendation, to be a
<pb facs="tcp:41849:6"/>man <hi>according to Gods own heart,</hi> and God hath ſetled and eſtabliſhed his kingdom, and his throne to him and his ſeed for ever; but <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is ſaid to have made <hi>Iſrael to ſin,</hi> and the Prophet told his wife, that the Lord would bring evill <hi>upon the houſe of Jeroboam,</hi> and would take away the remnant of his houſe, as a man taketh away the dung, till it be all gone. <hi>1 Reg. 14.10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what is the reaſon of all this, that <hi>David,</hi> who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be more vitious, and tainted with more ſins then <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> was, ſhould notwithſtanding be ſo perpetually bleſſed, and the other ſo ſeverely and ſo ſuddenly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed?</p>
            <p>It may be anſwered, that although <hi>David</hi> had, as well as other men, many humane frailties, wherein it cannot be ſaid, he was according to Gods own heart; yet his principal care was, and his heart was wholly ſet, to ſee the true God rightly honoured, and his ſervice to be duly and truly performed, as you may find how zealous he was to bring the Ark of God, and to ſet it in his place, in the midſt of his Tabernacle that he had pitched for it, and to offer burnt-offerings, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, before the Lord, and how deſirous did he ſhew himſelf to build God a Temple? and notwithſtanding all his great affaires, and his many and mighty wars, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of troubles; how he compoſed his Pſalmes, and directed them to the chief Muſicians, <hi>Aſaph, Altaſchith, Jeduthun,</hi> and the reſt; and ordered the Prieſts and Levites to diſcharge the ſervice of God and of the Tabernacle, according as the Lord had commanded the ſame to be obſerved by his ſervant <hi>Moſes.</hi> So careful was he at all times, and before all things, to have the ſervice of God rightly and duly performed; And therefore, herein he is ſaid to be a man according to Gods own heart, and God bleſſed him, and eſtabliſhed him and his ſeed in his throne for ever.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> though perhaps he was freer, and more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemious from many other ſins, then either <hi>David</hi> himſelf, or many other men were; and it may be, a very juſt <hi>morall</hi> man; yet, when he came into his kingdom; he wholly neglected to ſee the Lords ſervice truly executed, and out of a politick
<pb facs="tcp:41849:7"/>conceit, as he conceived, to ſecure himſelf and his poſterity in his newly gotten power and authority, <hi>he caſt out the Prieſts of the Lord, the ſons of</hi> Aaron, that were the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> Governours, and the true ſervers of God, and gathered together a company of novices and young fellowes, the <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> and baſeſt of the people, that <hi>were not of the ſonnes of Aaron,</hi> and that for ſome ſmall preferment, would both ſay and do, whatſoever he pleaſed, and ſerve, what god ſoever he commanded, and with what ſervice ſoever he liked, he made them Prieſts of his <hi>high places,</hi> to offer ſacrifices to his golden gods: And therefore is he ſaid <hi>to make Iſrael to ſin,</hi> and God ſoon rooted him and his poſterity out of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that God had given unto him.</p>
            <p>And ſo he can do with all thoſe Kings and Monarchs, whatſoever they be, that by their timorous conniving with Sects, or a popular favouring either the <hi>greater part,</hi> or the <hi>ſtronger</hi> ſide, do think it the moſt <hi>politick</hi> courſe, to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely eſtabliſhed, and ſo ſuffer the ſervice of God, to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglected, or perverted, and the faithfull Governours of his Church, to be <hi>ſuppreſſed,</hi> through the impetuous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of aſpiring emulators, or the clamorous deſire of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant vulgars; whereas the <hi>beſt policy</hi> in the world, to preſerve them is, to be men of <hi>courage,</hi> to uphold the true ſervice of God; this <hi>fortitude</hi> being a vertue moſt <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> both for the <hi>Prince</hi> and the Preacher, <hi>quia timiditas eorum, eſt calamitas multorum,</hi> becauſe their fear will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the fall of many; when the one dares not ſay the truth, and the other will not do what is juſt, or will do what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, for very fear: whereas the upholding of Gods right ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is able to uphold them againſt all opponents.</p>
            <p>And therefore, that the true ſervice of God might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, uncorrupted, and unchanged, by all Kings and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, which is the chiefeſt thing that God requireth at their hands, and is the principal thing that can preſerve them in their Majeſty, and perpetuate the ſame unto their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it is moſt requiſite, they ſhould be very carefull in the choice of their ſpiritual teachers and guides, to direct them for the preſervation of the true worſhip of God; for
<pb facs="tcp:41849:7"/>we know the Arian Biſhops made <hi>Conſtantius</hi> an Arian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> made <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabell,</hi> ſo zealouſly affected to the ſervice of <hi>Baal,</hi> and ſo the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts make Papiſts, and the <hi>Run-a-gadoes</hi> out of the Church do, when they return, make Sects and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Church; and therefore, as it had been good for <hi>Ahab,</hi> if he would have hearkened to <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah,</hi> as he did to the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> and good for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius,</hi> if he had as well favoured the Orthodox, as he did the Heterodox, and Arian Biſhops; ſo it will be good, and the beſt courſe to guide all Kings, Monarchs, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the people, for the ſetling of the true ſervice of God, to give ear unto, and to countenance thoſe, who are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, to direct them in Gods ſervice, rather then to any others; for the grave and reverend Governours of the Church, are like the diſcreet Counſellours of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and will adviſe them not to liſten, nor to relie ſo much upon the directions of any novices, which may prove like the counſel of thoſe young favourites of <hi>Rehoboam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have freely expreſt my mind to your Majeſty, ſo plain, that he which runs may read it, and reading it, may eaſily underſtand it; and I humbly beſeech you to bear with my plain dealing; for, though it behoves not us to polu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pragmatize in things that are beyond our line, and without the compaſſe of our calling, and to intermeddle with the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; yet, as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt told <hi>Herod</hi> of his duty to God, ſo it behoveth us, with the ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> to inform our Kings &amp; our Governours, how they ſhould uphold Gods ſervice; or if we neglect the ſame, for fear of their diſpleaſure, we ſhall make our ſelves liable to the diſpleaſure of God Almighty; and ſo, as <hi>Lucian</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And if theſe <hi>hedges</hi> and fences of Gods Church, the Biſhops and Governours thereof, be <hi>broken</hi> down, their Court ſuppreſt, and themſelves nullified and annihilated, as that long Parliament did, it is as <hi>impoſſible,</hi> to keep out <hi>Sects,</hi> Hereticks, and falſe Prophets from the <hi>Church,</hi> as it is to keep the <hi>civil ſtate,</hi> and common-wealth in peace, and to have <hi>juſtice</hi> and equity duly preſerved among all men, without the <hi>civil Magiſtrates,</hi> and their Courts of juſtice: for as theſe protect the <hi>innocent,</hi> and puniſh the <hi>Maleſactors,</hi> with the powerful ſword of juſtice; ſo muſt the Biſhops and Governours of the Church, which are beſt able to judge of divine queſtions, defend the <hi>truth,</hi> and, as Chriſt whipped <hi>the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple,</hi> ſo muſt they by their cenſures, whip all thoſe Sectaries and Heteticks, that will not other wiſe by fair means be driven, out of Gods Church; becauſe, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>qui nolunt duci, debent trahi.</hi>

            <p>And it is not unknown to any, that hath taken notice of the tranſac ions of theſe times, how that <hi>long,</hi> laſting, and intended to be an endleſſe <hi>everlaſting</hi> Parliament, hath kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our moſt heroical, religious, and renowned King, the moſt conſtant <hi>Martyr,</hi> and the firſt and chiefeſt of the two witneſſes of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt, and alſo Doctor <hi>William Laud</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cantcrbury,</hi> and ſuppreſſed <hi>all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> that were the other witneſſe of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>And now, moſt <hi>honourable,</hi> and moſt <hi>renowned</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, you have moſt <hi>juſtly,</hi> moſt <hi>religiouſly,</hi> and moſt gloriouſly, to your everlaſting praiſe, revived the firſt and chief Witneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and reſtored the government of theſe nations to be <hi>Monarchicall,</hi> that doth moſt reſemble God himſelfe, which is the <hi>ſole Monarch</hi> of all the world, and is the government that the <hi>moſt nations</hi> of all the world hath ever uſed, and eſpecially this kingdome, ſince the firſt peopling of it; and you have put the Crown upon His head, to whom your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes knew, It <hi>juſtly</hi> belonged, which was the <hi>onely</hi> way to bring <hi>Peace,</hi> and to make theſe kingdomes <hi>happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It reſteth, that the <hi>other</hi> Witneſſe of Chriſt be <hi>revived,</hi> and the Government of the <hi>Church</hi> be reſtored, as it hath been ever fince the Apoſtles time, to be <hi>Epiſcopal;</hi> and ſo to raiſe the Biſhops, and other Miniſters, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants (that, as yet, <hi>lye unburied in the ſtreets of the great City)</hi> to their <hi>priſtine</hi> dignity, to their offices, their authority, and their <hi>former</hi> eſtates; for their <hi>inabling</hi> to diſcharge their duties in the government of God's Church, they having ſuffered wrongs and indignities <hi>enough</hi> already.

            <p>And becauſe of the <hi>multiplicity</hi> of <hi>Sects,</hi> and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of opinions that have ſprung in this our Church ſince the <hi>killing</hi> of the witneſſes, and that the faith of Chriſt is to be <hi>perſwaded,</hi> by the <hi>word</hi> of God, and not <hi>forced</hi> by the <hi>ſword</hi> of man; I humbly beſeech you, to grant ſuch <hi>toleration,</hi> as your wiſdomes ſhall think fitting, to ſuch <hi>weak</hi> and tender conſciences, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, on the <hi>ſudden,</hi> comply with us in our ſervice to God, untill that by a <hi>friendly</hi> conference, <hi>painfull</hi> preaching, and writing of learned books, we <hi>captivate</hi> their underſtanding, and bring them <hi>ſo</hi> to the <hi>truth,</hi> and true faith of Chriſt, and ſervice of God; and not by <hi>rigid</hi> wayes; and too ſevere cenſures and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to compell them, either to be <hi>hypocrites</hi> in our Church, or <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> to run out of our Church. For I would not have the people of God to be <hi>driven,</hi> hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and <hi>harraſed,</hi> like as we drive <hi>wild</hi> beaſts, but to be led <hi>gently,</hi> and eafily, like ſheep; <hi>Leni ſpiritu, non dura manu,</hi> by an <hi>inward</hi> ſweet influence, and not by any <hi>outward</hi> violence.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:41849:10"/>
            <p>And here I <hi>humbly</hi> beſeech your Honours to give me leave to tell you; what I am not ſuffered to be ſilent, <hi>videlicet,</hi> that to take away the <hi>Lands</hi> and poſſeſſions of men, that <hi>never</hi> rebelled, nor offered <hi>any</hi> violence, nor the <hi>leaſt</hi> wrong, to any of our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> people in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but <hi>relieved</hi> them, and hindred others as <hi>much</hi> as they could, to abuſe them, and yet to diſpoſſeſſe, and to caſt them out of their inheritances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and profeſt themſelves <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks (as the <hi>long</hi> Parliament, and their ſubordinate inſtruments in <hi>Ireland</hi> have done, to the utter ruine of <hi>many</hi> ancient families, both of <hi>Brittiſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> extract) is not onely, as I conceive, moſt <hi>unjuſt,</hi> but alſo contrary to all Chriſtianity, and farre enough from <hi>humanity</hi> it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle bids us, <hi>to honour all men,</hi> that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are men, be they of <hi>what</hi> religion ſoever they pleaſe, their <hi>different</hi> ſenſe ſhould not make us to <hi>deſtroy</hi> them, ſo long as they live <hi>peaceably</hi> amongſt us, as you know the <hi>Sodomites</hi> permitted <hi>Lot,</hi> that profeſſed not their religion, and the <hi>ſevere</hi> Phariſees ſuffered both the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Eſſaei,</hi> to enjoy both their <hi>lands</hi> and their eſtates, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>troubling</hi> them for their religion; and would you make the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion more <hi>unjuſt,</hi> and worſe then theſe? Sure none would do that, but the <hi>great Antichriſt,</hi> that would hinder all, to think <hi>well</hi> of the religion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore I hope your <hi>wiſdomes</hi> and juſtice will be ſo far from <hi>confirming any</hi> injuſtice done by that long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or their under-agents, either to theſe <hi>diſplanted Iriſh,</hi> or <hi>ejected</hi> Clergy, or any others, that you will chriſtianly <hi>redreſſe,</hi> what they have ſo <hi>unjuſtly</hi> done amiſſe: leſt the <hi>continuance</hi> of theſe <hi>crying</hi> wrongs here on earth, do pull down upon us all the <hi>flying</hi> vengeance of God,

            <p>THis book, as very many can bear witneſſe, was fully finiſhed above two years agone, in the time of <hi>Oliver</hi> the uſurper, and I was very ready then to undergoe the danger that ſhould enſue the publiſhing thereof, and was as earneſt to have it printed; but either becauſe ſome of the things propheſied of (as the reviving of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) were not, as then, fulfilled; or becauſe of ſome fears which my friends conceived from the Governours that then ruled, I could not by any means, get it to paſſe through the preſſe; but now, all the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that are any where in the holy Scripture mentioned, concerning the coming, and the proceedings of the Antichriſt, being fully and cleerlie fulfilled, and come to paſſe, as I have ſhewed in this book, ſave onely one part of the laſt propheſie, touching the reſuſcitation of the laſt witneſſe, which ſome ſuppoſe to be unfulfilled, and the Presbyterians <hi>hope,</hi> will never be, as we explain it, and we <hi>conceive</hi> it done, or as good as done already, when, (as Chriſt ſaid to Saint <hi>Peter, &amp; tu con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus, confirma fratres</hi>) ſo Gods prime and principal witneſſe, being ſo gloriouſly riſen, to the joy of all hearts; he will do, as Chriſt willeth him; ſtretch forth his royall hand, as Chriſt did to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to pull the other witneſſe, out of thoſe waves, that were ſo ready to ſwallow them up, and ſet them to the ſterne of the ſhip again; and then, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſpes impiorum peribit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore as I have been at all the paines in compoſing it, ſo I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Gods aſſiſtance, and only for the ſervice of Gods Church, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe any coſt, to the uttermoſt of my ability, to publiſh it unto the world; and to bear all the blame, aſperſions or puniſhment, that either friend or foe, publick or private, can lay upon me for the ſame; for I call hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth to witneſſe, that I have long ſtudied, and ſeriouſly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated upon the ſenſe and meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, in thoſe places of the Scriptures, that foretold us of the coming of the great and egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Antichriſt; and I have <hi>often</hi> prayed, and moſt <hi>earneſtly</hi> and heartily deſired of my God, to grant me the true and <hi>right</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof; as, who he ſhould be; where he ſhould riſe; what feats and Tragedies he ſhould effect; how long he ſhould continue; by what means he might be diſcovered; and how he ſhould be ſubdued, and at laſt utterly deſtroyed; and I believe God hath now granted my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt;

            <p>And if any man ſhall blame me for any acrimonie or bitterneſſe that he findeth in this book, I call God to record, that it proceeded not as I ſaid before, out of any exceſſive ſenſe that I ever conceived of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular injury that was done unto my ſelf, when as I found my friends favourable enough to me, and granting me more then I expected from them; nor out of any hatred or malice to any one of all the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Independants, or Lay-preachers, or to any other of all the long Parliament men; when as very many of them were my beſt Patrons, and my ſingular good friends, that offered me great preferments, which I would have accepted, if my conſcience had not utterly diſliked of their wayes; but whatſoever gall or vinegar hath diſtilled from my pen, it proceeded only out of the vehemencie of the zeal, which I bear to the true ſervice of God, and the love that I had to the piety and goodneſſe of our good King, and eſpecially the extream hatred, that I conceived againſt the injuſtice, impieties, and evil doings of the men anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in this book; for my faith is, that although heretofore, many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular tyrant, heretick and wicked man, might be noted out of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that perhaps might be worſe, and more deteſtable then any one of theſe men here meant; yet that ſuch a pack, ſuch a ſociety, and ſuch a multitude of wicked hereticks, tyrants, and malefactors, that combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and were like ſworne brethren, to effect ſuch un-heard-of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, injuſtice, and impieties, as they have done, the ſun, in above <hi>5000.</hi> years revolution, never ſaw the like, except that wicked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, which condemned the Son of God to death.</p>

<note place="margin">How to know whether the Antichriſt be come or not.</note> Conſider well what you <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>ſee,</hi> whether the <hi>things,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> the things, that were <hi>propheſied</hi> ſhould be done by the great Antichriſt, were not <hi>all</hi> acted and done <hi>modo &amp; forma,</hi> as they were fore-ſhewed, here in <hi>Ingland,</hi> even in <hi>theſe</hi> our daies or not? And then judge your ſelves, whether he be <hi>come</hi> or not; and <hi>who</hi> he is, and <hi>where</hi> ſeated: For I ſhall do no more, but ſhew you, what was <hi>propheſied</hi> of the Antichriſt, that he ſhould do; and demand, if you have not <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>heard</hi> of all thoſe things that he

               <p>And theſe that were reaſonable good Schollars, but fiery, mad and furious men, did, through their violent proceedings, get ſo many Proſelites, and Diſciples after them, that, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith of the former Hereticks, in a very <hi>ſhort</hi> ſpace, <hi>numeri eorum multiplicati ſunt ſuper numerum,</hi> they increaſed like the <hi>rats</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that do <hi>ſuper-faetare,</hi> beget young <hi>ones</hi> before they be delivered of their <hi>old</hi> brood; And this <hi>grand hoſt</hi> of his Inſtruments the Devil perſwaded, and <hi>egged</hi> them forward to proſecure their enterpriſe, and never to give <hi>over</hi> and deſiſt, untill they ſhould effect theſe 3 things.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>And ſo you ſee <hi>this</hi> point, how far we may compel men to the Faith, diſcuſſed; and how the <hi>Weapons</hi> of Gods Church are <hi>spiritual;</hi> and that the City of God doth never exerciſe any <hi>cruelty</hi> upon any one, nor any <hi>temporal</hi> puniſhment for <hi>spiritual</hi> points, ſave only in ſome particular caſes of meer <hi>neceſſity</hi> and of great moment, as I ſhewed before, and that alſo on thoſe that were her <hi>children,</hi> and not on <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> that never were within the <hi>Pale</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> compelleth all men to ſubmit to her,
<note place="margin">The outward civil and teni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roman Church.</note> more with the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> ſword of the Magiſtrate, than with <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod and the <hi>spiritual cenſure</hi> of the Word of God; and that likewiſe without any reſpect of <hi>Perſons,</hi> and without all ſhew of <hi>Clemency,</hi> as witneſſeth their cruelties againſt the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> their Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres in <hi>France,</hi> their Inquiſition in <hi>Spain,</hi> and thoſe unmerciful perſecutions here,

               <p>And therefore, though we had none <hi>other</hi> Argument, yet this their <hi>uſual</hi> cruelty againſt their <hi>Brethren</hi> and good Chriſtians, might ſerve for a <hi>ſufficient</hi> teſtimony to prove the Church of Rome to be none of the beſt Saints of God, but the Citizens of <hi>Babylon:</hi> For it is an <hi>infallible</hi> truth, that Hereſie, apoſtaſie and cruelty are ever <hi>joyned</hi> and combined together; and whereas <hi>mercy</hi> and clemency do compaſs about the true Servants of Chriſt, <hi>ſeverity</hi> and cruelty do fill the hearts of the Hereticks, Schiſmaticks and Apoſtata's.</p>

<note place="margin">2 Chron. 15.17.</note> And ſo as the Lord ſaid of King <hi>Aſa,</hi> that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had not taken away the <hi>High Places</hi> out of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet his heart was <hi>perfect</hi> all his daies: It may be, that although they cannot, through their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or dare not, through <hi>Fear,</hi> or be not able, through their <hi>mean eſtate</hi> and poor condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>excutere phaleras,</hi> and to caſt off the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Garments, as blind <hi>Bartymaeus</hi> did his Cloak, yet may their hearts be <hi>ſound</hi> and perfect towards Chriſt and his Church: and to reject <hi>theſe</hi> from the <hi>Communion</hi> of Saints, were no better than a <hi>proud cruelty,</hi> or at leaſt, a <hi>defect</hi> of Chriſtian Charity.</p>

<note place="margin">The ſin of the Antichriſt like unto the ſin of the Jews.</note> to be juſt <hi>like</hi> unto the ſame, and never committed, either by the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Turk,</hi> or any other <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon whatſoever, when it is to be done by <hi>a court,</hi> and a collected multitude of men, which therefore maketh the ſin the <hi>more</hi> odious and abominable in the <hi>ſight</hi> of God, and of all good men.</p>

                  </label> I anſwer, that Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> thought that this Propheſie was fulfilled in the <hi>Smalcaldick</hi> War, under <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th; the which miſtake, Mr <hi>Mede</hi> doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confute, ſo that I need not ſtand to diſprove this errour; but if I demand, whether King <hi>Charles</hi> and his Magiſtrates, and the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and his Clergy were not the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt? I preſume none will, none can <hi>juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> deny the ſame: and if againe it be demanded, whether the <hi>long</hi> Parliament and their <hi>adherents</hi> did not make war with the <hi>King,</hi> and accuſe the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>rest</hi> of the grave Doctors and faithfull Preachers of this Church, for <hi>innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and a high Project of bringing in <hi>Popery</hi> into this our Kingdome? which unjuſt ſuſpition and <hi>groundleſs</hi> jealouſie they ſpread <hi>every where</hi> among the people, to ſet them on <hi>fire,</hi> and to gallop unto the <hi>War</hi> againſt the <hi>King,</hi> to preſs him to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,</hi> confirme and <hi>ratifie</hi> their <hi>covenant,</hi> whoſe <hi>principall</hi> ſcope was to roote out and to overthrow the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and the Eccleſiaſticall Governors of Gods people, which were the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> faithfull <hi>Witneſſe</hi> of Chriſt: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive all this is ſo well <hi>known</hi> to all the Kingdome, that every one will confeſs it; and, as they cannot deny the <hi>War</hi> with theſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> ſo they muſt yield, that theſe <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Biſhop,</hi> were vanquiſhed and <hi>killed;</hi> I am ſure that Parliament hath overcome the <hi>King,</hi> and he is <hi>killed,</hi> which was the <hi>ſupreame</hi> Magiſtrate, and one of the two Witneſſes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And I find the <hi>names</hi> of ſuch perſons, as did <hi>actually</hi> ſit as <hi>Judges</hi> upon the Tryall of his Magiſty, with the <hi>Councill</hi> and attendants on the Court, which they called the <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> to be theſe.</p>

<note place="margin">Why the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and afflictions of the Church are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed.</note> and <hi>foreſheweth</hi> to this <hi>end, videlicet,</hi> to teach the <hi>true believers</hi> in Chriſt, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of thoſe <hi>former</hi> Martyrs, that had already <hi>ſuffered,</hi> under thoſe five perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, that were fallen and dead, to be now (in the time of this 6th, and <hi>after,</hi> in the 7ths time, and under the Tyranny of the <hi>beaſt,</hi> which is the 8th,) moſt <hi>patient</hi> in all their ſufferings, and to <hi>comfort</hi> themſelves in all their miſeries and <hi>afflictions,</hi> when they do conſider, and weigh their own preſent ſtate and condition, with the <hi>precedent</hi> condition of thoſe holy Martyrs, that have ſuffered as much or more then they, and are now, for their conſtancy and patience in their perſecutions, <hi>crowned</hi> by Chriſt with <hi>eternall</hi> glory; and alſo, to put his ſervants in mind, from what <hi>divine providence,</hi> and to what <hi>end,</hi> theſe perſecutions are ſent unto them; when they do conſider, they come not by <hi>chance,</hi> being thus foretold, ſo <hi>long</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come, but by the <hi>ſpeciall</hi> appointment of Almighty God, that knoweth what is <hi>beſt,</hi> and diſpoſeth all things for the <hi>beſt,</hi> and for the <hi>ſpeciall</hi> good of them <hi>that love him;</hi> and then laſtly, to aſſure them of a <hi>glorious</hi> ſucceſs, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Victory to become <hi>Conquerours,</hi> even when they are <hi>conquered,</hi> and do ſuffer their perſecutions unto death; becauſe the <hi>ſame</hi> ſpirit that <hi>foretells</hi> us of their coming, <hi>tells</hi> us alſo, how our Brethren, that went before us, overcame <hi>all</hi> their ſufferings, and how we ſhall overcome them in like manner, even when our ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſeem to <hi>overcome</hi> us.</p>
               <p>And therefore immediately after the deſcription of our <hi>enemies,</hi> Chap. 13. and the ſetting down of our <hi>ſufferings,</hi> v. 7. the ſpirit of God addeth,
<note place="margin">v. 9.</note> v. 9 <hi>Here is the patience and the faith of the Saints;</hi> that is, their <hi>patience</hi> in ſuffering and their <hi>faith</hi> concerning their ſufferings, to believe that they come from <hi>God,</hi> for their good, and ſhall produce all good <hi>ſucceſs</hi> unto them.</p>

<note place="margin">The foreſaid Emperours not all ſo great perſecutors of the Church.</note> were not all ſuch <hi>great</hi> perſecutors of the Chriſtians; but ſome of them were very <hi>Gentle</hi> and meek, as <hi>Titus</hi> the Son of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> who was therefore called <hi>deliciae generis hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,</hi> the delight of mankind; though indeed he was not altogether ſo <hi>delightfull,</hi> nor ſo <hi>gentle</hi> to the Chriſtians; and others ruled but a very <hi>ſhort</hi> ſpace, as <hi>Galba</hi> reigned but ſeven moneths and nine dayes, <hi>Otho</hi> but four moneths, <hi>Vitellius</hi> but eight moneths, and we read of <hi>no great evills,</hi> that theſe three men did unto the Chriſtians, though they were <hi>no good men;</hi> and after theſe, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> reigned but nine years and eleven moneths, and <hi>Titus</hi> but two years, and twon moneths; So that all theſe <hi>five</hi> from <hi>Nero</hi> to <hi>Domitian,</hi> reigned not above fourtee years; and therefore I conceive that theſe five could not be <hi>meant</hi> to be ſet in the Catalogue of the <hi>chief</hi> perſecutors of Gods Church, nor be ranked in the ſame <hi>Claſs</hi> with the <hi>beast</hi> and his adherents, when as neither <hi>Euſebius</hi> nor any other <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Hiſtorian reckoneth the <hi>firſt</hi> three amongſt the perſecutors.</p>

               <p>Yet I ſhewed you before, how the ſpirit of God tells us in the ſecond verſe of this Chapter, it is not <hi>God,</hi> but the <hi>Dragon,</hi> that is, the Devill, which is indeed, the <hi>god</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that hath given this <hi>power</hi> and this <hi>great</hi> authority unto the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> to make Warre with the <hi>Saints,</hi> and to <hi>overcome</hi> them; God giving <hi>leave</hi> unto the <hi>Dragon</hi> ſo to do, without whoſe <hi>leave,</hi> we know he could give no more <hi>power</hi> unto the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> then he himſelf had againſt holy <hi>Job,</hi> and that was <hi>none</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt tells us, that <hi>power</hi> was given unto the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and that, as our Saviour ſaith unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> he could have <hi>no</hi> power, <hi>except it were given him from above,</hi> that is from <hi>God;</hi> ſo the <hi>Beast,</hi> the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and all the <hi>Tyrants</hi> of this World, could receive <hi>no</hi> power from the <hi>Dragon,</hi> except <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Fountain</hi> and the <hi>Authour</hi> of all power, <hi>permitted</hi> the <hi>Dragon,</hi> as his Inſtrument, to give it them, we do acknowledge the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Victories</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſes</hi> of that

               <p>Let him want all <hi>good</hi> ſucceſs, that judgeth actions by the ſucceſs; for if you pleaſe to look into <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 12.1, 2, 3, &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.7.10.35, 36. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.3, 4, 5. &amp; 18, 19, and 20. verſes, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.7. and into many of the like places of the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> you ſhall find, that the more men proſper in their bad wayes, the more ſure they are to be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and the more <hi>fearfull</hi> ſhall be their deſtruction.</p>

               <p>And ſo all their <hi>Narratives</hi> of their <hi>extraordinary</hi> Victories, and moſt <hi>fortunate</hi> ſucceſſes, in <hi>Ingland, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> do not prove them to be the <hi>Saints</hi> of God, nor their doings acceptable in his ſight; but they do <hi>ſufficiently</hi> prove, that <hi>they have made Warre with the Saints, and have overcome them,</hi> and as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> hath typically propheſied of the Beaſt,

               <p>Yet, to ſhew the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of fleſh and blood, and the <hi>blindneſs</hi> of frail man, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and to judge of things, the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, v. 8. that the Victories and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the <hi>Beast,</hi> do ſo far prevail <hi>with all that dwell upon the Earth,</hi> that is, all <hi>earthly</hi> and <hi>worldly</hi> minded men,

                  </note> that they are moved thereby, <hi>to worſhip the Beaſt,</hi> that is, to admire him, to adhere unto him, and to aſſiſt him, in all his projects and perſecution of the <hi>Saints,</hi> which is done, as the ſpirit of God ſaith by all thoſe, <hi>whoſe names are not written in the Book of life, of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the World,</hi> that is, by all <hi>carnall</hi> and worldly men, that are not inlightned with the <hi>truth</hi> of Gods ſpirit.</p>
               <p>But I would adviſe both them and all men elſe, ſeriouſly to conſider, how <hi>fearfull</hi> is the condition of thoſe <hi>Worſhipers</hi> and aſſiſtants of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> when as God himſelf doth teſtifie, they are not in the Catalogue of Gods Children, but are <hi>bletted</hi> out of his Book, as <hi>Reprobates</hi> to be tormented with the <hi>Beast,</hi> in the <hi>Lake of fire, burning with brimſtone for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore our good God gives a <hi>Caveat</hi> to all the <hi>Servants</hi> of Chriſt in the next verſe, ſaying, <hi>if any man have an ear to hear,</hi> that is, a will and deſire to hear, <hi>let him hear,</hi> that is ſo <hi>attentively</hi> and conſiderately, that he might <hi>rightly</hi> underſtand what he heareth; for that is not a matter of ſmall moment, and ſlightly to be paſſed over, but they that have any regard of their eternall ſalvation, or <hi>deſire</hi> to avoid <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi> deſtruction, ought carefully to examine, who are meant by the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and then <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> to weigh in what <hi>ſad</hi> and lamentable condition the <hi>Worſhippers</hi> and adherents of this <hi>Beaſt</hi> do remain in.

               <p>Secondly, leaſt he ſhould be miſtaken in the <hi>inſpiration</hi> of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are <hi>many</hi> ſpirits, by the appointment and <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that had his <hi>Authority</hi> from God, to approve of his Vocation, and to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi> him in his <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Office: thus was <hi>Aaron</hi> called; and yet more then this;

               <p>Nay, more then all this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, the time would come, as we ſee now it is come, when <hi>men would not endure to hear ſound Doctrine,</hi> but after their own luſts ſhould <hi>heap to themſelves Teachers,</hi> having itching eares, which they ſhall turn away from the truth unto fables:

               <p>And if the <hi>old Doctors,</hi> and the Faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt undertake to Preach, they are <hi>affronted,</hi> as I foreſhewed, and ſo <hi>threatned</hi> and terrified, that the people are afraid to hear them; whereby you may ſee, that, as the Apoſtle ſaith, the <hi>ſound Doctrine,</hi> and True Service of God cannot be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be heard; by reaſon of ſuch <hi>heapes</hi> of falſe Prophets, and wandring ſtars, that are ſprung up amongſt us.</p>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Saul</hi> was a moſt <hi>malicious</hi> man, and as cruell as any one of thoſe times, as you may read, how he perſecuted and hunted after the life of <hi>David,</hi>

               <p>And to <hi>juſtify</hi> what I ſay of theſe <hi>Presbyters,</hi> the chiefeſt branch of this <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> as I will not refuſe a pearle from a dung-hil, ſo I will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to alledge the teſtimony of <hi>George Fox</hi> the younger, in the eleventh page of his book, whoſe copy was delivered into the hands of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> the fourth day of the fourth moneth, 1660. where he ſaith unto the King; if thou ſhouldſt come in upon the account of the <hi>Prethyterians,</hi> or ſhouldſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to <hi>bow</hi> to what they ſhould ſet up, or not <hi>Jatisfy</hi> the covetouſneſſe of their Prieſts, there be ſeveral of them would be ready to ſerve thee as they did thy <hi>Father;</hi> and a little after he ſaith, how <hi>abominably</hi> have theſe durty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, covetous <hi>Prieſts,</hi> acted in all theſe changes, <hi>i.e.</hi> which he had formerly ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Oh! it is hard to utter their <hi>deceit,</hi> who one while have prayed for a King and Parliament; and when they ſaw the King was like to fall, and no ways likely to maintain <hi>them,</hi> they turned againſt him, and prayed <hi>onely</hi> for the Parliament, and aſſerted their <hi>authority,</hi> and <hi>curſed</hi> them that would not go out to help againſt the <hi>mighty;</hi> and ſhortly after, when <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> had turned out the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſet up himſelf; they cryed him up and prayed for him, and many of them began to aſſert his <hi>authority</hi> to he <hi>juſt:</hi> and when he died, many of theſe Preachers began to addreſſe themſelves to his <hi>Son,</hi> and fawned upon <hi>him,</hi> that he might provide for their God, which is their belly; and they appeared to be <hi>ſorrowful</hi> for his Fathers death, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly termed him, the <hi>Light of their eyes,</hi> and the <hi>breath</hi> of their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrills; and they told <hi>Richard,</hi> that God had left him to carry on that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work which his Father had begun, and ſome of theſe Preachers compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Ol.

               </head>
               <p>SO you have the <hi>marke</hi> of the beaſt; the <hi>name</hi> of the beaſt, and the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of his name; touching which <hi>number;</hi> before I proceed any <hi>further-</hi> I muſt yet ſay <hi>ſomewhat,</hi> in anſwer to Mr. Potters <hi>interpretation</hi> of this <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of the <hi>beaſt,</hi> which is 666; for I have with a great deal of <hi>delight,</hi> read over the ſame, and I muſt <hi>truly</hi> confeſſe, he hath done it with a great deal of <hi>induſtrie,</hi> ſobriety, and variety of reading; ſufficienty commending, the <hi>ingenuity,</hi> and the learning of the man, which the very <hi>adverſe</hi> party, without bluſhing, cannot denie; yet <hi>pace ſua,</hi> I muſt crave <hi>leave</hi> to ſay, that this <hi>whole</hi> diſcourſe, how <hi>exactly</hi> ſoever compoſed, doth not ſeem to mee, to be <hi>ſufficient,</hi> by an apodicticall, and unanſwerable neceſſity, to manifeſt his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,</hi> to be <hi>infallibly</hi> beleeved for truth; and therefore though the Parliament hath dealt with me, and the <hi>reſt</hi> of Chriſt his ſervants, as the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> did with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> take away their <hi>weapons,</hi> and left no Smith in <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi> to make them <hi>new</hi> ones; that is, plunder us of our <hi>bookes,</hi> and leave us not any <hi>meanes</hi> to provide any more; yet, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſlew a <hi>thouſand</hi> of thoſe <hi>uncircumciſed</hi> Philiſtines, with the Jaw-bone of an Aſſe, ſo may a booke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs man, and weaponleſs man, with the ſtrength of <hi>truth,</hi> and good reaſon, anſwer and overthrow the <hi>ſutleſt</hi> arguments, and moſt ſeeming probabilities of the moſt <hi>famous,</hi> yet miſtaking, Schollars; and ſo I hope I ſhall plainly, and yet <hi>ſufficiently,</hi> declare the miſapplication, and <hi>ſiniſter</hi> interpretation of that <hi>learned</hi> mans diſcourſe; For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas he ſaith, <hi>Epiſt. ad lect: page</hi> 4. <hi>that</hi> this his interpretation ſuppoſeth the <hi>number</hi> 666. to be <hi>animage, and a typicall repreſentation of the whole body of Antichriſt;</hi> that is, of the whole body of his <hi>kingdome,</hi> ſtate, and Hierarchy; what if I <hi>deny</hi> this <hi>ſuppoſition?</hi> it is but <hi>Marcus ait, Scaurus negat; ſit penes lectorem ſides;</hi> the reader may as well beleeve my <hi>deniall,</hi> as his <hi>affirming</hi> of it; and if it be but a typicall repreſentation of the <hi>body of the</hi> Antichriſt, then I ſay with the Schooles, that <hi>typica theologia nihil point in eſſe, neque eſt argumentatiua,</hi> types and ſimilitudes, <hi>quae non currunt quatuor pedibus,</hi> which hold not in all points, and run not, as they ſay upon <hi>all four,</hi> may ſerve onely for illuſtrations, <hi>ſecundum materiam ſubjectam,</hi> but not for an <hi>undeniable</hi> confirmation of a moſt <hi>neceſſarie</hi> truth; ſo this <hi>foundation,</hi> and ground-work being undermined, as not <hi>ſufficiently proved,</hi> but only <hi>barely ſuppoſed, tota machina ruit,</hi> the whole <hi>frame</hi> of the ſuperſtructure, muſt, like the houſe built upon the <hi>ſand,</hi> fall to the ground.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he ſaith <hi>eadem epiſt. pag.</hi> 6. that the following interpretation of this <hi>number</hi> 666, and the <hi>effect</hi> thereof dependeth <hi>chiefly</hi> upon the <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the <hi>root,</hi> of the <hi>number,</hi> 666. and ſaith pag, 5. that the text ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>let him that hath underderſtanding count the number of the beaſt;</hi> i.e. <hi>ſuch arithmet.</hi> underſtanding, as can finde out the <hi>root</hi> and figure of the beaſt, by <hi>extracting</hi> the root of 666. I <hi>utterly</hi> denie this to be the end of counting the number of the beaſt, to finde out the <hi>root</hi> of this number 666. but he that hath any <hi>ſpirituall</hi> underſtanding, let him
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41849:144"/>count the <hi>number</hi> of the beaſt, that ſo he may finde out the <hi>beaſt,</hi> that is, the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and not finde out the <hi>root</hi> of the number; otherwiſe the holy Ghoſt, which defireth not, and uſeth not to <hi>amaze</hi> his children, would ſet down <hi>obſcurum, per obſcurius,</hi> a myſterie to be underſtood, and found out, by a far <hi>obſcurer</hi> and by a more enigmaticall myſterie, that none but <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and a moſt <hi>skilfull</hi> Arithmetician could finde out; therefore I ſay that the Holy Ghoſt, in bidding the <hi>underſtanding</hi> men to count the <hi>number</hi> of the beaſt, meaneth not thoſe, that had <hi>ſuch</hi> a high meaſure of <hi>arithmeticall</hi> underſtanding, as, could extract the <hi>root</hi> &amp; figure of this <hi>number</hi> of 666. which in reſpect of the <hi>fractions,</hi> and the diverſity of <hi>opinions</hi> about it, would prove a moſt intricate <hi>laborinth;</hi> but that we ſhould do it according to the <hi>uſual</hi> cuſtom among men; for which cauſe perhaps the text ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for it is the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of a man, or the number, or <hi>manner</hi> of numbering, that a man <hi>commonly</hi> uſeth to number, which is not by extracting the <hi>roots</hi> and figures of any number, which but <hi>verie verie</hi> few can doe, but by counting the <hi>number,</hi> that the <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericall</hi> letters,
<note place="margin">Which are the letters that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticians count by.</note> 1. u. x. l. c. d. m. which we finde in the <hi>beaſt</hi> and in his <hi>name,</hi> doe make up, which I am <hi>confident,</hi> is the <hi>manner</hi> and common <hi>cuſtome</hi> of numbering among men, and hath been ſo underſtood, to be here meant by all <hi>former</hi> interpreters, ſince the time of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> that <hi>firſt</hi> underſtood it, as I doe, of the <hi>numericall</hi> letters of the name of the Antichriſt, which he thought might be <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This then, being the <hi>meaning</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, (that we <hi>finding</hi> this <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of 666. in the <hi>beaſt,</hi> and in his <hi>name,</hi> that ſhould containe this <hi>juſt</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 666, might thereby underſtand, who is the beaſt and the Antichriſt, and not by the extracting of the <hi>roote</hi> of this number, thereby to know the <hi>beaſt,</hi>) the whole <hi>frame</hi> that is built upon this his <hi>conceit</hi> falls to nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas he ſaith, <hi>eadem epiſt.</hi> pag. 7. that it may be verie <hi>well</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that this his interpretation, is <hi>darke,</hi> and obſcure in ſome degree, and as it is <hi>darke</hi> and intricate, ſo muſt it alſo be acknowledged to be <hi>new</hi> and unheard of in <hi>former</hi> times; therefore I ſay the <hi>difcovery</hi> of the Antichriſt, being a point of ſuch <hi>great</hi> concernment to the <hi>whole</hi> Church, it ſhould be very <hi>well,</hi> plainly, and ſufficiently proved, and manifeſted, and not <hi>darkly</hi> and improbably demonſtrated, or elſe it ought <hi>hardly</hi> to be received, and not <hi>at all</hi> to be beleeved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas pag. 2. of this interpretation, he ſaith, that becauſe, <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorum eadem eſtratio,</hi> and that the <hi>myſterie,</hi> of 144. to which this <hi>number</hi> of 666, is oppoſed, is contained in the <hi>roote</hi> thereof, which is 12, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>myſterie</hi> of this 666. muſt be contained in the <hi>roote</hi> thereof; which is 25. I ſay; that the <hi>miſterie</hi> of 144. is indeed interpreted to conſiſt in the <hi>roote</hi> thereof, which is 12. which being 12 times <hi>multiplied</hi> doe make up <hi>juſt</hi> 144. and yet the Holy Ghoſt, maketh no <hi>ſuch</hi> interpretation of it, but that <hi>thoſe</hi> ſpirits, which beleeve nothing but the <hi>expreſſe</hi> text of ſcripture, may as eaſily <hi>reject</hi> it, as <hi>receive</hi> it; but being granted, that this is <hi>rightly</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, becauſe the twelve Apoſtles (St. <hi>Paul</hi> left out, that laboured in the building more then <hi>any,</hi> if not, then <hi>moſt</hi> of them all) were the <hi>foundations</hi> of the wall of the <hi>new</hi> and ſpirituall <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet, it followeth not, that becauſe <hi>this</hi> myſterie, muſt be explained by the extraction of the <hi>roote</hi> of 144. therefore the other myſtery, that denoteth the <hi>beaſt,</hi> muſt conſiſt in the <hi>roote</hi> of 666, no more then the myſteries of <hi>many</hi> other numbers, expreſſed in ſcripture, can be ſaid to conſiſt in their extracted <hi>rootes;</hi> and, though the <hi>beaſt</hi> be oppoſite to Chriſt, and the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of Satan oppoſite to the Church of Chriſt, or <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet this doth not in any underſtanding, prove that 666, is more oppoſite to 144. as it is a <hi>ſet</hi> number, then it is to 444, or to any other definite number; 333, being, as I conceive a more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite number, in reſpect of diviſion, to 666.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:41849:144"/>
               <p>Onely <hi>this</hi> 666, is ſaid to be the <hi>number</hi> of the <hi>beaſt,</hi> in direct, and plain termes; and the other <hi>number,</hi> of 144, is interpreted by ſome authors to be underſtood of the Church <hi>militant,</hi> here on earth; and by others, of as good repute, to be the typicall expreſſion of the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
