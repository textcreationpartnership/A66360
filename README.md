    _ CHAP. I. To what end Chriſt foretels the Afflictions and Perſecutions of his Church; that her greateſt Perſecution ſhould be in the time of the great Antichriſt: and of the ſtrange Perſecution, and extream Cruelty, Oppreſsion and Injuſtice, that have been lately acted againſt Gods ſervants in theſe parts, and in our daies by the Miniſters of the Antichriſt.

    _ CHAP. II. That neither the Pope nor the Turk is the great Antichriſt; that the Antichriſt when he ſhould come into the world, ſhould ariſe out of the Trueſt and Pureſt Reformed Church on Earth; which was the Church of Ingland, in King Charles his time, being fully reformed of thoſe Errors and Abuſes that ſhould creep, and had crept into the Church, which other Reformed Churches had not ſo perfectly purged: And wherefore they did it not, and could not do it.

    _ CHAP. III. That the Antichriſt is no ſingle Perſon, but a Collected Multitude of men; Who thoſe men might be; Of the Grand Apoſtaſie, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, that made way, and opened the Door wide, for the Antichriſt to enter in; That it is neither the Apoſtacy of the Prime Hereticks, nor of the Eaſt Churches, nor of the Roman Church; but of ſome purely Reformed Particular Church, ſuppoſed to be, and demanded if it be not the Church of Great Brittain.

    _ CHAP. IV. Of the Literal and Mystical Babylon: That Rome is a Babylon: That neither the great Babylon in Aſſyria, nor old Rome, nor Conſtantinople, which was called new Rome, is that Babylon spoken of Rev. 17. and where the Antichriſt ſeateth himſelf, but that is to be myſtically and not literally underſtood, for ſome City of confuſion: and what the Prophet Daniel intimateth the Antichriſt ſhould do, by the doings of Antiochus, that was the most lively type of the great Antichriſt, in his rebellion againſt his Superiours, and his perſecution of Gods People, the Jews.

    _ CHAP. V. Of the ſpecial particular ſin, that is the proper ſin, and peculiar only to the Antichriſt, and to none elſe; and the ſin that is moſt deſtructive to Mankind, and moſt hateful unto God; and what is meant by the Antichriſt his exalting himſelf above all that is called God, and that is worſhipped; and of his ſitting in the Temple of God, as God.

    _ CHAP. VI. That the Antichriſt is a great Profeſſor of Religion, and a ſeeming Saint; That he belyeth his Profeſſion, and is indeed the greateſt Hypocrite in the world; What the great Lye of the Antichriſt is: What〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉ſignifieth: What it is to deny Jeſus to be the Chriſt: And how the Father and the Son may be denied two manner of waies.

    _ CAP. I. The meaſuring of the Temple; the two Witneſſes that ſhould erect and build the Chriſtian Church; who they are; how long they ſhould Propheſie; how they ſhould be killed, and uſed after their killing; how they ſhall be reſuſcicated and revived; and in what time they ſhall be revived after they be killed; and of the great myſtery of God, what it is, and when that ſhall be finiſhed.

    _ CAP. II. Who is here meant by the Woman Cloathed with the Sun;
Cap. 12. Of the Revelation treateth. who is meant by the Dragon; and by the Man child; when the Church began to be freed from her bloody perſecution; how long ſhe was freed from it; what is meant by the War of Michael and the Dragon; the laſt bloody War and perſecution of the Dragon, how long it laſteth; how the Church is relieved in this bloody perſecution; and Junius his interpretation of this Woman rejected.

    _ CAP. III. The three principall enemies of Gods Church; Satans 1000 years impriſonment, when begun, and when ended; when the Chriſtian Religion tryumphed over the Idolls of the Gentiles, and over all the Gods of the Heathens; that the beaſt ſignifieth the great Antichriſt, and a pack or confederacy of moſt wicked men; from whence it ſprung; of the ſeven heads of the beaſt; what they are, handled at large; and the Authours opinion of the ſeven Kings and the eighth, that is the beaſt and the Antichriſt.

    _ CAP. II. The 10 Horus of the Beaſt, who they are, and what they may ſignifie: their Crowns, what they ſignifie; their blaſphemy; the three chief properties of the Leopard; how agreeable to the long Parliament; of the feet and mouth of the Beaſt, what they betoken; of the power and authority of the Beaſt; and the head that was mortally wounded, who or what is meant thereby; and how the Beaſt ſhall continue to make Warre.

    _ CAP. II. The blaſphemy of the Beaſt, 1. Againſt God by the Doctrines of the Presbyterians, and as it is alledged, the manifold injuries of the long Parliament. 2. Againſt his Tabernacle, that is, the Churches and places, where God is worſhipped and ſerved, and which the prime Chriſtians had to ſerve God in them; Of the twofold ſervice of God; at what times God might be ſerved in any place; the two things that Jeroboam did to uphold his Idolatry; how God will be ſerved, in the time, by the perſons, after the manner, and in the places where he appointeth; and in what ſence all things are alike holy, and in what ſence ſome things are more holy then other things.

    _ CAP. IV. The Blaſphemy of the Beaſt againſt the Saints in Heaven; the firſt deſpiſers of them; the Blaſphemy againſt the Godly Saints on earth; who are the Saints with whom the Beaſt warreth; the ſucceſſes of the Beaſt; that we ought not to wonder at his Victories; what the ſucceſſes of the Beaſt ſhould teach us; and of the end and downfall of the Beaſt.

    _ CHAP. I. Who is to be underſtood by this beaſt of the earth, not Mahomet, nor the Idolatrous Priests of the heathen Temple; when S. John was baniſhed into Patmos: That the Preachers of the antichriſt, and not the Biſhop of Rome and his Clergy, but the aſſembly of Preſbiters, Independants, and Lay Preachers are the Prophets of the firſt beaſt; when the ſeed of this beaſt of the earth was firſt ſown; and when it became firſt apparant in theſe parts: and that this beaſt of the earth is far worſe then the firſt beaſt, that aroſe out of the ſea.

    _ CHAP. II. Why this ſecond beaſt is ſaid to be riſen out of the earth; what is meant by the two hornes of this beaſt, and the two things ſignified by them; what it is to ſpeake like the Dragon. Of the wonders, or miracles of the Beaſt, all falſe, in reſpect of the foure ſpeciall cauſes of true miracles; and of the fire that this Beaſt bringeth down from Heaven, what it ſignifieth.

    _ CHAP. III. Of the image of the firſt Beaſt; what is meant thereby: what it is to give life to the Image of the Beaſt; the two things, that the Beaſt, animated by the falſe Prophet, immediately acted; and the two things, that the Long Parliament Acted, immediately after they were juſtified, incouraged, and animated by the Aſſembly of the Presbyterians; of the marke of the Beaſt, and of the ingagement, and of the great iniquity of the ingagement.

    _ CHAP. IV. Of the name of the beaſt; what it is; and of the number of his name; how agreeable it is to the name of the long Parliament.

    _ CHAP. 5. Of the interpretation of Mr. Potter, that would prove the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, in this miſterie, to be, by extracting the roote of this number 666, which is 25, and is in all particulars, anſwerable to the Hierarchy and Church of Rome, plainely, and breifly anſwered; of the name of Independent; the great perſecution of the long Parliament, and of their groſſe and palpable hypocriſie, that are two infallible marks of the great Antichriſt.

    _ CHAP VI. Four ſpecial Objections anſwered; wherein the right uſe of all the foreſaid diſcovery of the Beaſts and the Antichriſt is declared, and the precedent Diſcourſe more fully confirmed.

    _ CHAP. VII. Of the continuance, and deſtruction of the beaſt; the time of his prevalencie; his utter ruine not till the day of judgment; and why? and what it ſhould teach us; how the ſeven Vials of Gods wrath ſhall be poured out; and what the three unclean ſpirits do ſignifie,
